# WorldSim Enhancement TODOs

## Time Control

- Add time manipulation controls (pause, speed up, slow down, jump to specific times)
- Implement time presets for quick jump to dawn, noon, dusk, midnight

## Simulation Features

### Natural Processes
- Implement erosion simulation with terrain height/color changes over time
- Add seasonal changes with color palette shifts throughout longer cycles
- Implement temperature simulation affecting snow accumulation/melting as color changes

### Weather & Climate
- Add cloud shadows that move across the terrain
- Implement rain effects with dynamic wetness that affects surface properties
- Add snow accumulation on surfaces
- Implement fog that varies with terrain height and time of day
- Create dynamic weather patterns with moving cloud systems

## Rendering Improvements

### Advanced Rendering
- Implement a basic PBR model with albedo, roughness, and normal maps
- Add terrain texture blending for smooth color transitions between biomes
- Implement particle systems for dust clouds, leaves, snow particles
- Create animated water surfaces with ripples, waves, and flow patterns
- Add bloom/HDR rendering to enhance lighting effects
- Implement distance fog/atmospheric perspective for depth

### Night Sky
- Implement a star field for night sky with proper celestial motion

## Performance Enhancements

### GPU Optimization
- Move heightmap and colormap generation to GPU using compute shaders
- Implement multiple detail levels based on distance from camera
- Only calculate detailed shadows for nearby terrain
- Progressive terrain loading for large worlds
- Implement mipmapping for the colormap to reduce aliasing at distance
- Create texture atlases for different terrain types

## Technical Debt

### Code Architecture
- Implement an entity-component system for game objects
- Create a more flexible shader management system

### Tools
- Add profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks
- Create a settings UI for graphics options
